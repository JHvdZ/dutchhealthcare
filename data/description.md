# Healthcare costs data

The data used in this study comes from https://www.vektis.nl/streams/open-data.
Vektis publishes yearly healthcare costs files in which the healthcare costs are grouped in age groups
broken down by sex for each municipality. Besides that files are published in which the healthcare costs are grouped at 
a so called postcode3 level, geographic areas defined by the first three characters of the postcode.

In the first instance, the analyzes are based on costs at the municipal level.
The files at PC3 level are kept behind for more in depth analyses.
